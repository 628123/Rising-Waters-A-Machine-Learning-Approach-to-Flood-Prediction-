🌊 Flood Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the probability of flood occurrence using Machine Learning techniques based on environmental and geographical features. A user-friendly web interface is developed using Flask where users can enter input parameters and receive flood prediction results instantly.
The system helps in early warning and decision-making by analyzing factors like rainfall, population density, drainage, and geographical data.
